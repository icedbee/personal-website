                    Hi! My name is Anthony Roman and I'm currently a Computer Science Master's 
                    Candidate at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I graduated with my
                    bachelor's of science degree from the same university in May of 2023 and
                    and will graduate with my Master's degree in December of 2024. This website
                    is something that I want to put some of my work on to have more of an
                    interactive resume. I also wanted to start improving my skills as a web
                    developer and attempt something I haven't done before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is made with just HTML and CSS as of right now, but in the
                    future I plan to add some other features which would require other components.
                </p>
