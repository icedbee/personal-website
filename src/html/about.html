                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Anthony Roman and I'm currently a Computer Science Master's 
                    Candidate at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I graduated with my
                    bachelor's of science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity
                    from the same university in May of 2023 and will graduate with my Master's 
                    degree in December of 2024.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a detail-oriented, team player, computer Science student who possesses good
                    written and oral communication skills. I am a friendly and social problem solver 
                    who is hardworking and enjoys working in teams. Critical thinking and 
                    determining effective solutions are what I thrive on. I have a multitude of 
                    coursework in cybersecurity, a field I'm quite interested in.
                </p>
